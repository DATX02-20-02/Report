\section{Problem}
The projectâ€™s goal is to create a program using PCG which can generate a reusable 3D-model of a city and the terrain in the vicinity from a list of specifications given by the user.
The main focus of this task is to generate versatile cities.
The terrain is used for creating scenarios from which the cities have to adjust to, for example, rivers, oceans and steep hills.

A desirable, yet not completely necessary, function would be to export the result to a standard model file such as .fbx.
That way the result can be moved and imported to any game engine of choice or a 3D-modeling program.
Realization for this could be done using Unity 3D and its FBX Exporter package.

To start with, the algorithm has to create terrain, roads, cells and entities.
