\section{Problem}
\label{sec:problem}

This section addresses the original bachelor project proposal and goes into detail about how this group chooses to further define the problem.
The intention is to analyze the problem that will be tackled in as great detail as possible, so that concrete potential solutions can be presented in the Method section that follows.
Considering that this is a plan, some details are bound to change.
Nonetheless, this problem definition should provide a solid foundation from which to work from.

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly application that can generate modern 3D cities, and then export them as \textit{.fbx} files.
\textit{User-friendly} means that users should not need any technical expertise or coding experince to fully utilize the application.
\textit{Modern cities} will in this project be defined as cities that resemble modern industrialized cities such as New York, Paris, San Francisco, and Tokyo.
Figure~\ref{fig:ModernCities} showcases two examples of such modern cities.

It is worth clarifying that suburban areas and rural areas are also included as
part of such cities.

The scope will be restricted to generating static models that can be exported as \textit{.fbx} files.
Therefore, dynamic content such as simulation of road traffic, day-night cycle, and pedestrians are all considered out of scope for this project.
The interior of buildings are also considered out of scope.
The reason being that each user is predicted to want more control over what content the buildings are filled with than the project's time frame can support.

The primary focus will be put on the generation of roads and buildings, as these are considered the core features of a city.
The terrain's purpose should be to help create natural settings for the infrastructure to adjust to, and the terrain itself does not need to have realistic level of detail.
Furthermore, the details of roads and buildings, such as textures and small meshes, are not intended to be made from scratch.
Utilization of free resources online is encouraged to keep the workload focused on algorithmic problems rather than on 3D modeling.

As a consequence of the random aspect in PCG, it is difficult to express a precise definition that can measure whether the project should be considered successful or not.
One possible measurement is the \textit{quality} of the exported models.
Do the cities look like real ones?
Are they visually pleasing and are they suitable for use in other mediums such as movies and games?
Another possible measurement is how \textit{expressive} the generation is.
If all generated models look exactly the same, then the power of PCG has gone unused.
Each generated model should stand out, and to the untrained eye it should not be apparent whether a human or a computer made them.

The subjective nature of these measurements will make evaluation challenging, but they can still be used to give a rough estimate.
The plan is to measure all of the mentioned aspects from the perspective of the project members, the project's supervisor, and from a sample of unrelated university students.
This will be done through a survey at the end of the project.

The user could interact with the application's Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the following way.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The user specifies the size of the world in terms of a 2D plane.
  \item The user specifies any optional parameters that affect the terrain
    such as sea level.
  \item The user clicks on a button that says ``Generate Terrain'' as many times
    as they like, until they are satisfied with the generated terrain.
  \item The user selects which region of the generated terrain they want to use in the final model.
  \item The user places population markers on the terrain and specifies how much
    population each marker represents. The user can also specify any optional
    parameters for each marker such as road type.
  \item The user clicks on a button that says ``Generate Roads'' as many times
    as they like, until they are satisfied with the generated road network.
  \item The user clicks on a button that says ``Generate Buildings'' as many times
    as they like, until they are satisfied with the generated buildings.
  \item Finally, when the user is satisfied with the result they can click on a
    button that says ``Export to FBX'' and the the program will save the full
    model as a \textit{.fbx} on the local file system.
\end{enumerate}

As a stretch goal, the user should after step 7 be able to select blocks of a city and regenerate those individually.
With such a feature in place, the user would be able to finely adjust parts of the generation to their preference.
This feature would not require any additional mandatory steps for the user to take.
Another desirable stretch goal would be a button to go back to previous steps.

The problem addressed in this project can be divided into 3 major subproblems: terrain generation, road generation, and building generation.
Each of the following subsections will go into more detail about these subproblems.
