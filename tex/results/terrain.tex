\section{Terrain Generation}

The very first option in the application is to generate the terrain.
It creates a mesh that will be given a height value from a random noise map.
Some variables that affect the terrain terrain can be adjusted by the user, those options being:

\begin{easylist}
 @ Sea level: increases or decreases the water level
 @ Offset X and Z: slides along the respective axis in the noise map, changing the height values of the terrain.
 @ Size X and Z: Adjusts the size of the entire terrain.
\end{easylist}
