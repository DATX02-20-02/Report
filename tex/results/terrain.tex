\section{Terrain Generation}

The very first option in the application is to generate the terrain. It creates a mesh of triangles that will be given a certain height value from a noise map. Some variables that affect the terrain terrain can be adjusted by the user, those options being:

\begin{easylist}
 @ Sea level: increase or decrease the water level
 @ Offset X and Z: slide along the respective axis in the noise map, changing the height values of the terrain.
 @ Size X and Z: Adjust the size of the entire terrain.
\end{easylist}
