\section{Plot Generation}
Each block that is sent into the PlotGenerator is treated differently depending on what the block label is. 
If the block label is either \textit{Parks} or \textit{Parking}, then the PlotGenerator does not split the block. 
The entire block is turned into a plot and is sent to ParkGenerator or ParkingGenerator respecitvely.
The rest of the block labels are split into n parts, where n depends on the area of the block and some randomness. 

Figure~\ref{fig:plot} and \ref{fig:plot2} demonstrates some example outputs from the PlotGenerator.

Each plot is assigned a plot label, which is later used for the PlotContentGenerator to determine what should be generated within the plot.
The plot labels are \textit{Manhattan}, \textit{Skyscraper}, \textit{Park}, \textit{Parking}, and \textit{Empty}.
\textit{Manhattan} and \textit{Skyscraper} are two different sub-generators for BuildingGenerator. 
\textit{Park} and \textit{Parking} are used by the ParkGenerator and the ParkingGenerator respectively.
If the plot label is \textit{Empty}, then no content is generated upon the plot.
