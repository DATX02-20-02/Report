\section{Future Work}
This subchapter highlights the possibilities of expanding CityCraft, mainly focusing on different ways to evolve the application beyond what we had time to develop.
An obvious way to further develop CityCraft would be to simply add more stuff onto the generators, such as additional road networks strategies, buildings types, and objects inside parks.
This would not only be a good way to stress the system, but would also make the generated cities further resemble reality.
 
As terrain was never a core focus of CityCraft, it would be fitting to give the user the option of providing the terrain themself, rather than generating it. 
The user could also be given the ability to either freely draw the population map, or to provide a heat map by importing an image. 
The road generation could also be expanded to include road markings, road signs, and possibly bridges, in order to further mimic the real world.
  
One way to further develop the building generation would be to simply include a larger set of textures, or to algorithmically generate textures in order to further increase visual variety.
Another area of interest is to generate the interiors of buildings as well as adding public transport infrastructure.
As for the parks, the generation of paths was implemented in a way that did not consider concave polygons, the two approaches for solving this which we considered were either altering the algorithm for paths, or alternatively, altering the way we divide plots.

However, the primary goal of future work should be to validate the theoretical system that CityCraft implements.
This could be done by comparing the algorithms and architecture proposed in this report with other approaches.
For instance, Voronoi Diagrams, WaveFunctionCollapse, and Machine Learning are all potential options for such comparisons.
By doing this, one could better identify the possible strengths and weaknesses with our proposed system.
