\section{Purpose}

% Open-source MIT
% user-friendly standalone application
% fast and easy (generate a custom city in less than 1 minute on modern laptop)
% must work with third-party software such as Blender and Unity

Cities are complex and massive architectural infrastructures that appear all over the world, and a significant portion of the world population lives inside them.
They are also a frequent scenery in digital media, such as advertisement, video games, and film.
Unfortunately, the creation of digital cities can be a highly time-consuming effort if done by hand.
Ideally, this task could be automated such that studios of any size could produce impressive cities by only specifying some rough design parameters.
The purpose of this project is to contribute towards such an ideal.

Formally, the purpose of this project is to research and combine various PCG techniques in order to discover and demonstrate a suitable approach for generating modern 3D cities. 
The intention is to demonstrate this approach by implementing and releasing a standalone city generation software.
This software should be free, open-source, and accessible to anyone in the industry of digital media.

The significance of such software compares to SpeedTree \cite{speedtree}, which revolutionized the process of creating realistic forests.
Of course, such an ambition is beyond realistic for the scope of this project, and that is why constraints have to be made.
