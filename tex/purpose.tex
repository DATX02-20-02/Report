\section{Purpose}
There is a demand within the modern game industry to create large, impressive and unique environments for their player base to explore.
However, this is costly and time consuming to build manually.
But if it is possible to create hills and caves using algorithms as Mojang does in Minecraft, why would it not be possible to generate whole 3D cities?

The purpose of this project is to, through a selection of various PCG techniques, investigate a suitable approach for the generation of a 3D City.
The program will be a desktop application that can generate large cities for use within virtual environments such as games, film and modeling.
The program should be suitable in the case where a great variation of interesting cities is needed with the goal to reduce the amount of time spent on manual editing.
