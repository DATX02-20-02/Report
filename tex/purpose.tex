\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this project is to, through a selection of various PCG techniques, investigate a suitable approach for the generation of modern 3D Cities. It is important to note that the focus of this project is not to invent new PCG techniques.  

The decision to not construct new techniques was made due to the fact that in the field of procedural generation there already exists a lot of available standardized techniques, such as L-systems and Perlin noise. 
The purpose of our project is to combine these techniques, and by doing so creating an algorithm for generating cities. 

The reasoning behind this project is to create something which could be put to use in what is believed to be a very rapidly emerging market. The generated models are also intended to be able to exported inte some standard format. Allowing people to freely use them for their own games or whatever purpose they may come up with. During the project we also seek to acquire some knowledge in a field of work that is very likely to become the norm in not only game-design, but really any field where modeling needs to be done on a greater scale.
