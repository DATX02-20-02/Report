\section{City Generation Architecture}
\label{sec:city-gen-arch}

In order to approach the problem of 3D city generation it was necessary to first break it down into manageable modules that could be worked on in parallel.
One of these modules had to be responsible for the GUI presented in the previous subchapter.
This module was named \textit{Application} and could be kept relatively small as most logic would be handled by the Unity engine.
There also needed to exist some module responsible for the PCG, since that is the core of this research.
This module was named the \textit{WorldGenerator}.
\textit{WorldGenerator} was then further split into eight submodules that would each be responsible for a distinct part of the model generation.

The implementation of the user interface would be rather simple and was thus treated as a single module, while the generation needed some architecture to handle the communication between submodules.
The two main architectures considered for the generation were a function-based and a pipeline-based approach (see Figure~\ref{fig:architecture_approaches}).

The pipeline had the advantage of less overhead since each generator would directly (or through an interface) pass data onto the next.
However, this lack of overhead could impose limitations and there still needed to exist some module responsible for receiving and exporting all the generated model data.
Furthermore, when Blomqvist et al. developed a PCG engine, they experienced issues with their pipeline architecture, such as interconnected modules and bias of workload towards the early pipeline stages \cite[p. 45]{ba_landscape}.
Thus, with these concerns in mind, it seemed reasonable to settle for the function-based architecture instead.

  \end{subfigure}

\end{figure}

The function-based architecture showed several promising advantages.
For one, each generator would only receive input that it actually depended on, while with a pipeline each generator would have had to pass along all its data.
This separation not only makes debugging easier, but it also improves performance slightly.
Another recognized advantage was that generators could now be run asynchronously and in separate threads, further benefiting performance.
Lastly, as generation steps would be invoked from GUI buttons, possibly in non-linear order and with \textit{undo} operations, it was better suited if \textit{WorldGenerator} could communicate with each sub-generator directly.
Consequently, the function-based architecture was chosen.
