\subsection{Street Generation}
The street generator uses the same method as the road generator, which also
shows the level of flexibility of the Agent based approach. The only difference
is that these Agents start on any of the nodes in the road network and uses a
street strategy, instead of starting as a city type strategy.

Streets are generally the same for most cities, in the sense that they are
usually straight and follow a grid type of pattern. Slight variations does exist
in the real world, where some streets are curved rather than straight. Sweden
especially has streets that are more curved, while other countries such as
America generally are more grid-shaped. However, the basic street strategy that
the method uses mimics the grid-like street style.
