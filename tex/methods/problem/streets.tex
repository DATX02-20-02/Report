\subsection{Street Generation}
The street generator uses the same method as the road generator, which also shows the level of flexibility of the Agent-based approach.
The only difference is that these Agents start on any of the nodes in the road network and uses a street strategy, instead of starting as a city type strategy.

Streets are generally the same for most cities, in the sense that they are usually straight and follow a grid type of pattern.
Slight variations do exist in the real world, where some streets are curved rather than straight.
From what the group members have observed, Sweden typically has more curved streets than other countries, such as America which generally has more grid-shaped streets.
However, the basic street strategy that the method uses mimics the grid-like street style.
