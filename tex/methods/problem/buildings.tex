\subsection{Building Generation}
The BuildingGenerator has the goal of generating different kinds of visually pleasing looking buildings. 
Everything from small houses to towering manhattan skyscrapers. 
This section describes the different methods used in creating a diverse BuildingGenerator and what techniques were considered and what, in the end, was chosen for the final BuildingGenerator. 

BuildingGenerator is needed because buildings are one of the most important parts of generating a convincing modern city. 
It is also essential to have a general generator that can create any building. 
This makes it easier to integrate the generation of buildings to the rest of the application. 
Having one generator exposed to every plot label of the building would quickly increase the amount of overhead needed to create a diverse looking city. 

No one algorithm can be used to create a procedurally generated building of any type. 
The BuildingGenerator has to be able to support different kinds of generations. 
The kind of generator that is selected to be generated onto a plot is decided by the plot label, e.g., villa or skyscraper. 
BuildingGenerator has the input of a plot and the general population of the plot. 
The different SubbuildingGenerators then has to generate some building that is affected by the population. 
There are two different strategies to generate buildings: Using an L-System or spawning a model of a building. 

L-system with a stochastic grammar was used to generate a visually pleasing and diverse set of buildings. 
The L system was implemented via generics to be able to handle the generation of any objects.
The generics that can be specified are the node types in the L-System and the data class type that is used throughout the generation. 

Some buildings, such as villas or kiosks, are too time-consuming to create some procedurally generated content that gives a significant result. 
Because of this, thereâ€™s a need to spawn already finished buildings within the world that correspond to the given plot label. 
With more time, one could start to generate these kinds of buildings as well, but we decided to draw the line at skyscrapers to lower the scope of the project.
