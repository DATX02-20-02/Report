\chapter{Discussion}

This chapter discusses the resulting city generation software, CityCraft, from three different perspectives.
First, the quality of the application and the city models it generates are estimated by addressing the checklist that was presented at the end of Chapter \ref{section:goal_and_scope}.
This perspective also argues how the choice of different algorithms could have affected the results.
Subsequently, the validity of the processes used during development is debated.
Finally, the last subchapter discusses further research.

% Ended up being a bit more about 3D graphics than intended, but that proved intresting challenges as well.
