\chapter{Results}

% Explain Like I'm 5
% Mention CityCraft on first page of introduction and in abstract as well.
This chapter presents CityCraft, the standalone city generation software that was implemented as a result of this research.
The first subchapter will focus on user-facing aspects such as interface, usage, and file exportation.
It will also feature examples of generated cities that have been exported and rendered in Blender.
The subsequent subchapters will then go into detail about the results that each PCG-based generator produces and how these results contribute to the final models.
