This chapter presents CityCraft, the standalone city generation software that was implemented as a result of this research.
CityCraft is a graphical desktop application that lets users interactively generate 3D cities, which can be exported as glTF files and used in third-party modeling software such as Blender.
The application combines computer graphics theory and several PCG techniques to achieve its results.
An example of CityCraft in use is shown in Figure \ref{fig:screenshot}, and a CityCraft generated model is shown rendered in Blender in Figure \ref{fig:blender}.

CityCraft's GUI follows the \textit{Wizard} design pattern \cite{yer_a_wizard} to guide its users through the generation process, which is split into four steps (see Figure \ref{fig:guisteps}).
The four generation steps are terrain, roads, streets, and cities.
The last of which performs the generation of buildings, parks, and parking lots.

The four generation steps of the GUI are implemented as eight PCG-based generators, all of which are orchestrated by a single module called the \textit{WorldGenerator}.
The following subchapters will go into detail about the results that each of these generators produces and how their results contribute to the final city models.
