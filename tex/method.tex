\section{Methods}
In this project, there were two different algorithms to create the city with.
Road-first, which is based on creating the roads first and cell-road-cell-road 

We will split the problem of city generation into the following 3 subproblems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Landscape generation
  \item Road generation
  \item Building generation
  \item (population generation?)
\end{itemize}

In essence, to generate the city model we first generate the landscape, then the road network, and then finally the buildings.
