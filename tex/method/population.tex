    \textit{Terrain, Population markers} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{PopulationGenerator} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Population map} 
\end{center}
This generator will from the generated terrain, and the user specified markers create a height map representing the population density for the world.
This will be useful when generating the roads and specifying the blocks from the roads. 
Some places within the world there is a larger need for high building with many appartments. 
Some other places are more suitable for supermarkets or villas. 
The population map will be the backbone and a large factor for theses generations.
