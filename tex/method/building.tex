\subsection{Building Generator}
\begin{center}    
    \textit{Plot} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{BuildingGenerator}
\end{center}
This building generator will generate a single building upon a given \textit{Plot}. 
The size of the \textit{Plot} as well as the required population will be an important factor for the generation and placement of the building. 
The plan is to implement stochastic bracketed L-systems for the generation of these buildings.
