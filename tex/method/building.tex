\subsection{Building Generation}
To start with, the buildingsâ€™ detail will be basic.
Concretely, they would look like simple cuboids with varying heights depending on what district they exist in (be it in the midst of the city or by the outskirts).
This because we do not want to focus on modeling as it is a very time-consuming task.
Small details such as windows, colour or similar considerate details might be added depending on time for the sake of beautifying, but it is not the focus for this project.
