\subsection{Tools}
These are a few of the tools that we have selected to use to create our project.

\subsubsection{Git/Github}
The industry standard for version control of code. 
A Github project will be used to store and maintain our git project.

\subsubsection{C\#}
The language that will be used for our project. 
There are two main reasons for us to choose this language, the first being that it is a language used in the game engine that we have selected. 
The second being it that is similar to Java, which is a language that all project members have previous experience with.

\subsubsection{Unity}
The game engine that will be used to interact, via UI elements, and represents, in 3D, our application.
