\subsection{Plot Generator}
\begin{center}
    \textit{Block, Population map} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{PlotGenerator} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Plot{[}{]}}
\end{center}
This generator will divide a \textit{Block} into multiple plots of land where buildings and parks can be built.
These \textit{Plots} are formally defined in the glossary.
Plots can not be divided into smaller pieces, they should be seen as the smallest polygon area where buildings and parks can be built.

An example of plot generation can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:generatorexamples3}.
The areas separated by the blue lines represent the \textit{Plots}.
These can be generated quite arbitrarily, and do not need to be of similar sizes.
In this case they could all represent different buildings, but parks are also valid candidates.
The only requirement is that they need to have enough room for something to be built.
One suggestion is to investigate using Voronoi diagrams for generating the \textit{Plots}, both with Euclidean distance and with Manhattan distance.

The population map can be used to determine what kind of building type is most suitable.
For instance a villa would fit well if the plot should cover a small population, while a skyscraper or an apartment complex would be suitable for high population.
