\subsection{Plot}
\begin{center}
    \textit{Block} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{PlotGenerator} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Plot{[}{]}}
\end{center}
This generator will from a \textit{Block} divide where different plots should be positioned. 
Formal definition of Plot:
\begin{center}
    \textit{Piece of land where a single building or park can be fit.}
\end{center}
Plots cannot be divided into smaller pieces, they should be seen as the polygon area where the actually content of the city is placed such as a building or a park.
The parameter \textit{Block} will also contain information such as how much population is expected to fit into the different plots. 
This fact will for example help determine if a skyscraper is needed for the plot, or just a family house for four people. In figure \ref{fig:generatorexamples3}, you can see plots being marked as the polygons divided by blue lines.
