\subsection{Plot Generator}
\begin{center}
    \textit{Block} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{PlotGenerator} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Plot{[}{]}}
\end{center}
This generator will from a \textit{Block} divide where different plots should be positioned. 
The formal definition of \textit{Plot}:
\begin{center}
    \textit{Piece of land where a single building or park can be fit.}
\end{center}
In Figure~\ref{fig:generatorexamples3}, you can see plots being marked as the polygons divided by blue lines. 
Plots can not be divided into smaller pieces, they should be seen as the polygon area where the actual content of the city is placed such as a building or a park.
The parameter \textit{Block} will contain information such as how much population is expected to fit into the different plots. 
This fact will for example help determine whether building a skyscraper, apartment or a villa is more appropriate.
