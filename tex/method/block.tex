\subsection{Block Generator}
\begin{center}
    \textit{Road network, Population map} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{BlockGenerator} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Block{[}{]}}
\end{center}
This generator will generate all of the city blocks, based on road network and the population map.
The formal definition of Block:
\begin{center}
    \textit{Finite area connected to 1 or more streets that contains 1 or more plots.}
\end{center}
An example of this can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:generatorexamples3}, the inner roads of the center area are streets from which three blocks have been generated.
After all the roads have been generated, doing most of the work structuring the world, blocks can be mapped upon the world to give it life.
Via the \textit{Road network} and \textit{Population map}, different blocks can be created. 
The main technique that will be used to find the blocks created out of the \textit{Road network} is something called Minimum Cycle Basis.
It is an algorithm used to find all cycles, which are called blocks, within an undirected graph, which will be all the roads and streets. 
The population map will affect when specifying the blocks.
